# Puca Plate Files

When uploading these files to create your custom cases - make sure the measurements are as follows:

 - Base Plate: 125 x 114 
 - Acrylic Guard: 125 x 32 
 - Top Plate: 125 x 82 

A fourth file is also provided which includes both top and bottom plates, as well as the acrylic guard which may save you some costs. 

Also, the top plate switch cutouts are 14.05mm - which means that for some materials like acrylic there will be compatibility issues with certain switches. You may want to modify this to 13.75mm in those instances.
